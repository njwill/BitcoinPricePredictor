Lower highs vs period high and momentum cooling.\n- 1-Week Chart Analysis: Micro down-bias: price under 1W BB middle (115,573) and 1W EMA20 (115,262), holding within tight weekly BBs (114,336â€“116,810). Intraday prints show support at 114,596 and lower highs to 115,162/115,131.\n- Timeframe Alignment: Both 3M and 1W lean mildly bearish with price under respective 20 EMAs and bearish MACD crossovers.\n\n**2. TECHNICAL INDICATORS ANALYSIS**\n- RSI Analysis: 3M RSI 47.47 and 1W RSI 47.33â€”neutral/slightly weak; no overbought/oversold. Momentum cooled from prior 60â€“70s to sub-50s.\n- MACD Analysis: 3M MACD -314 < signal 145 (bearish, expanding negative hist); 1W MACD -35.77 < signal 122.38 (bearish). No bullish crossover yet.\n- Bollinger Bands: Price within bands on both TFs, near 3M mid-band and just below 1W mid-band; weekly bands relatively tightâ€”potential for a breakout soon.\n- EMA Analysis: Price below 3M EMA20 (116,236) and 1W EMA20 (115,262). Short-term trend bearish unless reclaimed.\n\n**3. ADVANCED PATTERN ANALYSIS**\n- Chart Patterns: 3M: Emerging range-bound consolidation after topping near 124,457; potential descending mini-channel inside 116,970â€“114,596. 1W: Minor bearish flag-like drift under the 1W EMA20.\n- Candlestick Patterns: Latest 3M day (Aug 23) long upper shadow vs 116,970 and close near mid-rangeâ€”sellers active above 116,500.\n- Support/Resistance: Support: 114,596 (recent), 114,336 (1W lower band), 111,679 (1W period low).

DIVERGENCE ANALYSIS**\n- Price vs RSI Divergences: No clear current bullish divergence; RSI falling with price.\n- Price vs MACD Divergences: MACD and histogram confirm weaknessâ€”no bullish divergence signal.\n- Volume Divergences: Volume trend increasing on both TFs while price drifts downâ€”mild bearish volume divergence (distribution risk).\n\n**5. FAILURE SWING ANALYSIS**\n- RSI Failure Swings: 1W RSI failed to hold above 50s, rejecting 70s earlierâ€”bearish failure swing characteristics.\n- MACD Failures: Both TFs failed to sustain prior positive momentum; bearish cross holds.\n- Price Action Failures: Rejections near 116,970/115,162 indicate failed breaks above near-term resistance.\n\n**6.
